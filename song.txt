Let me die
I don’t really know what the point in life is
Everybody knows that we won’t survive
I just wanna go shawty, I can’t fight this
Always on my page but you never?like
It’s?fake
You?ain’t really love?me
That’s great
I been?counting up bankroll
All day
I been drowning in my problems
Let’s escape

I been in my bag
And I ain’t stopping bitch
I love poppin tags
So I been shopping
