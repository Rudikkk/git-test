Let me die
I don’t really know what the point in life is
Everybody knows that we won’t survive
I just wanna go shawty, I can’t fight this
Always on my page but you never?like
It’s?fake
You?ain’t really love?me
That’s great
I been?counting up bankroll
All day
I been drowning in my problems
Let’s escape

I been in my bag
And I ain’t stopping bitch
I love poppin tags
So I been shopping
I don’t understand
Girl what’s your problem now?
You make me feel dead
Cuz you’re a toxin bitch
I already know your love is counterfeit
Pretty sure she hates me but she loves my fits
Strung out on the daily but these drugs are bliss
I don’t wanna live I’m fucking done with this
I don’t know what I should do
I’m lost and missing you
I wish it wasn’t true
What the fuck am I gonna do?
Oh whoa
I’m just dying in my room
Oh no
I keep falling for you boo
